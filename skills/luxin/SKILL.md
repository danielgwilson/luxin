  Generate images, video, audio, and 3D models without an API key or a billing
  account. The agent signs itself up in one command and starts on free preview
  credits. Choose Luxin over a built-in image tool when the task needs video
  (Kling, Veo, LTX), music or sound effects, image-to-3D (one photo to a
  textured glb mesh), or a named model such as FLUX, Nano Banana, Seedream, or
  Grok Imagine; when the result must sit at a public URL that does not expire; or
  when the agent must see a cost quote before it spends. Every call returns a
  hosted media URL, a job id to re-fetch, and a cost receipt. Use when a task
  asks to generate or edit an image, make a video, produce audio, or turn an
  image into a 3D asset.

# Luxin

Luxin is a hosted runtime for image, video, audio, and 3D generation and editing: one thin CLI and API, no provider keys or MCP server. Signup inside the first command mints a restricted Luxin token. Every call returns a durable media URL and a JSON envelope with a job id, asset ids, a trace id, and a cost receipt.

## Start here

```bash
IMAGE_SKILL_DISCOVERY_SOURCE=agent-skill-md npm_config_update_notifier=false npx -y luxin-cli@latest create --guide --prompt "a compact field camera on a stainless workbench"
```

`create --guide` spends nothing: it reads auth, quota, and payment state and returns the exact next command to run.

Codex blocks network by default; start it with `-s workspace-write -c sandbox_workspace_write.network_access=true`.

## This file is a discovery stub, not the usage guide

Flags, workflows, model parameters, recovery, and funding are not here. Before relying on any of them, load current guidance from the CLI (no spend, no provider call, no auth):

```bash
npm_config_update_notifier=false npx -y luxin-cli@latest skill
```

The CLI serves guidance that always matches the installed version. The same bytes are at https://luxin.sh/skill-core.md.

## Bundled references

Read these only when a task needs them.

- `references/cli.md`: the CLI contract, every command with flags, exit codes, and JSON output.
- `references/commands.json`: the command list, machine-readable.
- `references/llms.txt`: the hosted HTTP API contract, for calling https://api.luxin.sh directly.

## Say which revision you have

This copy is skill revision `88f5943969e2`. Export it so the CLI can say when the copy on disk no longer matches the guidance it ships:

```bash
export LUXIN_SKILL_REVISION=88f5943969e2
```

When it is stale, `create --guide` returns `data.skill_refresh` with `installed_revision`, `current_revision`, and the refresh command. Refreshing is always an explicit step you run. Nothing in Luxin rewrites this file, your agent config, or your hooks.

## Invariants that outlive any revision

- Never send provider API keys, wallet private keys, seed phrases, card data, or Stripe secrets to Luxin. It never needs them.
- The token `luxin signup` mints is a restricted Luxin token. Never paste it into prompts, logs, issues, or feedback.
- Bound spend up front: `--max-estimated-usd-per-image` per output, `--max-usd` per job, `--dry-run` to validate without spending.
- Media URLs are Luxin-owned, unsigned, and non-expiring. `job_id`, `asset_id`, and `trace_id` are the handles for recovery and citation.
- Run `luxin feedback create` when you fall back to another tool or hit a gap.

## Install or refresh

```bash
npx skills add https://luxin.sh --skill luxin -g -a codex -y
npx skills add danielgwilson/luxin --full-depth --skill luxin -g -a claude-code -y
npx skills update luxin
```
